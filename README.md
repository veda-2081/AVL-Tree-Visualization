🌳 AVL Tree Visualization
📌 Project Description
This project visualizes how AVL Trees (self-balancing binary search trees) work by dynamically displaying insertions, deletions, and rotations in real time. It helps users understand the underlying balancing logic of AVL trees with smooth animations and interactive GUI elements. Built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas/D3.js), this tool is ideal for students, educators, and developers.

🧩 Features
🔄 Interactive node insertion and deletion

🖼️ Real-time graphical tree updates with animations

📐 Visual indicators for left, right, left-right, and right-left rotations

📏 Dynamic update of height and balance factors

🧠 Implemented core AVL logic: insert, delete, rotate

🎨 Smooth color transitions to highlight balance changes

💬 Simple GUI with input box and control buttons

⚙️ Software Installation & Setup
📌 Pre-requisites
Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

No installation needed for frontend-based version

If using a backend (optional):

Node.js / Python / Java installed based on backend language

📦 Technologies Used

🧪 AVL Tree Operations Visualized
Insertions

User enters a value and clicks "Insert"

Value is placed in the correct BST position

AVL tree balances itself if necessary

Deletions

User enters a value and clicks "Delete"

Node is removed with standard BST deletion rules

AVL tree rebalances using rotations

Rotations

Left Rotation (LL)

Right Rotation (RR)

Left-Right Rotation (LR)

Right-Left Rotation (RL)

🚀 How to Run the Project
🔹 If Web-based (Frontend only):
Clone or download the repository

Open index.html in your browser

Start inserting or deleting nodes using the interface

🔹 If Using Backend:
Setup the backend (Node.js/Python/Java)

Run backend server (instructions provided in respective folder)

Open frontend in browser and connect to backend if needed

🖥️ Demo GIF or Screenshot (Optional)
Add a GIF or image here to showcase how the tree rotates dynamically on insertion/deletion.
