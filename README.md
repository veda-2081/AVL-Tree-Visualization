# 🌳 AVL Tree Visualization

## 📌 Project Description

This project visualizes how **AVL Trees** (self-balancing binary search trees) work by dynamically displaying **insertions**, **deletions**, and **rotations** in real time. It helps users understand the underlying balancing logic of AVL trees with smooth animations and interactive GUI elements. Built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas/D3.js), this tool is ideal for students, educators, and developers.

## 🧩 Features

- 🔄 Interactive node insertion and deletion
- 🖼️ Real-time graphical tree updates with animations
- 📐 Visual indicators for left, right, left-right, and right-left rotations
- 📏 Dynamic update of height and balance factors
- 🧠 Implemented core AVL logic: insert, delete, rotate
- 🎨 Smooth color transitions to highlight balance changes
- 💬 Simple GUI with input box and control buttons

## ⚙️ Software Installation & Setup

### 📌 Pre-requisites

- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- No installation needed for frontend-based version

If using a backend (optional):
- Node.js / Python / Java installed based on backend language

## 🧪 AVL Tree Operations Visualized

1. **Insertions**
   - User enters a value and clicks "Insert"
   - Value is placed in the correct BST position
   - AVL tree balances itself if necessary

2. **Deletions**
   - User enters a value and clicks "Delete"
   - Node is removed with standard BST deletion rules
   - AVL tree rebalances using rotations

3. **Rotations**
   - Left Rotation (LL)
   - Right Rotation (RR)
   - Left-Right Rotation (LR)
   - Right-Left Rotation (RL)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 🔹 If Web-based (Frontend only):

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start inserting or deleting nodes using the interface

### 🔹 If Using Backend:

1. Setup the backend (Node.js/Python/Java)
2. Run backend server (instructions provided in respective folder)
3. Open frontend in browser and connect to backend if needed
