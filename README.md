### **AVL Tree Visualization**
GitHub hosts various **AVL Tree Visualization** projects, which help users understand how **AVL trees** work by dynamically displaying node insertions, deletions, and rotations in a graphical format.

#### **Typical Features of an AVL Tree Visualization GitHub Project**
1. **Interactive Interface:**  
   - Allows users to insert and delete nodes dynamically.
   - Visual representation updates in real time.

2. **Graphical Representation:**  
   - Uses **HTML5 Canvas**, **SVG**, or **D3.js** to draw the AVL tree.
   - Shows nodes as circles and edges as lines.
   - Highlights rotations to maintain balance.

3. **AVL Tree Implementation:**  
   - Includes **self-balancing tree logic** (insertions, deletions, rotations).
   - Uses **JavaScript**, **Python**, or **Java** for backend logic.

4. **Real-time Balancing Visualization:**  
   - Displays **left rotations**, **right rotations**, **left-right**, and **right-left rotations** when balance is disturbed.
   - Updates **height factors** and **balance factors** dynamically.

5. **User Input Support:**  
   - Text box for entering values.
   - Buttons for inserting or deleting nodes.

6. **Animations & Effects:**  
   - Smooth transitions when inserting or deleting nodes.
   - Color changes to highlight tree balancing steps.

#### **Languages and Technologies Used**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Canvas API, D3.js, p5.js)
- **Backend (if needed):** Java, Python, or Node.js for advanced features
- **Data Structures:** AVL Tree (self-balancing BST)

#### **Popular GitHub Repositories for AVL Tree Visualization**
You can find open-source projects by searching **"AVL Tree Visualization"** on GitHub.  
Some repositories include:
- **JavaScript-based AVL visualizations** (Canvas/D3.js)
- **Python-based GUI applications** (Tkinter, Pygame)
- **Java implementations** with Swing or JavaFX
