🌳 AVL Tree Visualization
AVL Tree Visualization helps users understand how AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) trees work by dynamically displaying node insertions, deletions, and rotations in a real-time graphical format. This project is ideal for students, educators, and developers learning about self-balancing binary search trees.

✨ Features
🔄 Interactive Interface
Insert and delete nodes dynamically.

Real-time updates of tree structure.

🖼️ Graphical Representation
Built using HTML5 Canvas, SVG, or D3.js.

Nodes displayed as circles; edges as lines.

Automatic highlighting of tree balancing rotations.

⚙️ AVL Tree Implementation
Includes core AVL logic: insertions, deletions, rotations.

Written in JavaScript, Python, or Java depending on version.

Ensures balance after every operation.

📈 Real-Time Balancing Visualization
Visual feedback for:

Left rotation

Right rotation

Left-Right rotation

Right-Left rotation

Live updates of height and balance factors for each node.

🎛️ User Input Support
Input box for custom values.

Dedicated buttons to insert or delete nodes from the tree.

✨ Animations & Effects
Smooth visual transitions.

Color changes indicate balancing steps and rotations.
